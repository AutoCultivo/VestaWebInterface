Vesta Web Interface is a PHP interface that integrates with the VestaCP API to provide a beautiful user friendly experience. VWI features the ability to rebrand the control panel, change the theme, install it wherever you want, restrict access to users, easily edit options and offers integrations to services such as Google Analytics, Cloudflare, Interakt and many more coming soon. 

Vesta Web Interface is currently only a user control panel, but admin control options will be coming soon along with more integrations, themes, and great features such as multi-server support.
